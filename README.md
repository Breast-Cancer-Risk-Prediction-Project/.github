# About the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Project

The Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Project (BCRPP) is developing a comprehensive tool that will predict breast cancer risk – overall breast cancer and tumor subtypes of the disease – across racial and ethnic groups.

The BCRPP is an international collaborative effort that includes data on over 1.5 million women from the National Cancer Institute's Cohort Consortium Study, and other large cohort studies. The project is harmonizing information on breast cancer risk factors including, breast cancer family history, anthropometric, life-style and reproductive factors, hormonal biomarkers, mammographic density, and polygenic risk scores.

The broad scientific goals of the project:

  • Develop a comprehensive and multi-ethnic model for estimating absolute risk of breast cancer by incorporating information on known breast cancer risk factors

  • Extend the multi-ethnic risk model for the risk prediction of breast cancer defined by tumor estrogen receptor status

  • Evaluate the validity of the risk models developed in Aim 1 and Aim 2 in integrated health care systems, mammography registries, and an ongoing risk-based mammographic screening trail in the US

In addition to these broad scientific goals, the BCRPP will also allow researchers to address a broad range of scientific questions.
